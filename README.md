# Node Poll

Node Poll is a simple app meant to show how [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) can be used to create real-time collaborative web applications. Users are able to create polls which they and other users are able to vote on in real time. A pie chart is updated as votes are cast, allowing users to see which option is winning at any given time.
